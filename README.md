- Created a functional web app.
- The user is able to control the web app with basic gestures.
- Followed good principles of UI design.
- Custom gestures: Our first custom gesture is one hand closed and one hand open and the second is one hand closed one hand pointing. We chose to do these types of gestures because we wanted more similar gestures to control insturments that are also more similar to each other.
- Our web app is simple and intuitive. The buttons are well spaced and the interactive pieces of the web application stick out against the background. We also added alt text for each for each of the images for accessibility purposes.

To run the webapp, run the commands:
npm install
ng serve --open
