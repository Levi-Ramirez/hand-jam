6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

Its an app to use for fun which makes it appeal to a wide range of users. It would be most fun for people who are interested in machine learning and computer vision.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.

Our first custom gesture is one hand closed and one hand open and the second is one hand closed one hand pointing. We chose to do these types of gestures because we wanted more similar gestures to control insturments that are also more similar to each other.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?

Our web app is simple and intuitive. The buttons are well spaced and the interactive pieces of the web application stick out against the background. We also added alt text for each for each of the images for accessibility purposes.
